Day 2 :

Picked up by San2Art (https://san2art.itch.io/)

Work done: 

- make an ability and assign keys ("E") which can create a child bomb
- duplicated and inheritated all acording to the primary bomb but colored yellowish
- added jumpiness to it
- make an ability and assign keys ("Q") which can make the bom floating for some time then when it drops it gets huge explotion


Visual update :

- added "Effect_1", "Effect_2", "Effect_3", "Effect_3" for live feel (fx : colorize, distortion, camera shake and vignette )


Tweaked for fast development :

- some of the values are turned off for development (exmaple : obj_player > step)  
- note : most of them are used this at the end "// <!> disabled for developpment"
- some of values are written in the middle of the game for quick debug
- some additional keys as well as secondary are assigned to give player choice and fast check


Bugs and fixes :

- when the bomb is dropping from top it's stuck for a sec
- while pressing fast q and e the game gets stuck
- while using q if used e it gave some time weird movement
- these abilities should gain throw time(drop from up or big enemies drop after die) or as level up [not able to finish in time]


# goal : 

player hp should not drop below 0 while destroying the enemies (my understanding to the game)
